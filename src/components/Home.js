            My entrepreneurship journey started 8 years ago as a quest to solve
            some of the worldâ€™s biggest challenges through technology. In the
            time period, I have passed through the fires and have come out
            refined; building a solid foundation of what it takes to identify
            problems, develop feasible solutions and turn those solutions into
            strong, viable businesses with my work being validated through
            world-class recognition from prestigious international bodies.
            Through this platform, you will have the unique opportunity to tap
            into my wealth of knowledge to help you on your journey to becoming
            a successful entrepreneur.
